# An RFC for Decentralized Stable Coin

## Discussion
[A decentralized stable coin without death spiral](https://github.com/StableCoinDAO/rfc/issues/1)

------
**The key features:**
1. It is a digital currency that exists in the blockchains and is controlled by a publicly persistent algorithm. It is not issued and controlled by any person, organization or legal person, and there is no problem of credit bankruptcy of the controlling entity.
2. It has no transaction tax, only Gas consumption to perform the algorithm.
3. It has no seigniorage, and the total value of its issue is equal to the total value of all collateral.
4. Since the total value of a society's assets increases, its total issuance will also increase. But instead of increasing issuance out of thin air, it follows the appreciation and exchange of collateral.
5. It will support a variety of collateral, such as USDT, USDC, BTC, etc., thus reducing the risk of system stability caused by the devaluation of certain collateral.
6. It has no absolute anchor, the stability value anchor will tend to be a large proportion of the collateral. For example, there may be more USDT and USDC in the early stage, which is equivalent to anchoring us dollars.
7. It addresses only the most basic needs - providing stable value exchange, with advanced financial features (such as mortgage yields, loans, etc.) provided by other services.
8. Any user can use it at any time -- just do it with a private key and a network, which is the basic capability of cryptocurrencies.

**核心特性：**
1. 它是存在于区块链网络，由公开固化的算法控制的数字货币，不由任何人、组织、法人发行控制，不存在控制实体信用破产问题。
2. 它没有交易税，只有执行算法的 Gas 消耗。
3. 它没有铸币税，它的发行总价值与所有抵押品的总价值是 1:1。
4. 由于社会总资产是增值的，它的发行总量也会跟随增加。但它不是凭空增加发行，而是跟随抵押品升值及兑换来增发。
5. 它会支持多种抵押品，如 USDT、USDC、BTC 等，从而降低由某种抵押品贬值带来的系统稳定性风险。
6. 它没有绝对的锚定物，稳定性价值锚定会趋向于占大比例的抵押品。比如初期可能 USDT、USDC 比较多，相当于锚定美元。
7. 它只解决最基础的需求——提供稳定价值兑换，高级金融特性（如抵押收益、贷款等）由其它服务提供。
8. 任何用户在任何时间都能使用它——只需要私钥和网络，这是加密数字货币的基本能力。
